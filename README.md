Manually adjusted kerning pairs for improved readability. Toggle "Metrics" setting in your preferred design software to apply.

## Opentype Features Support (default off)

Below are currently supported Opentype features. They are based on my personal idea and interpretation, which I haven't noticed in official arkworks so far. They are **off** by default. You may turn it on for fun.

### Case-Sensitive Forms `case`
![case](preview/case.svg)
> ¿Qué pasa? **¿**QUÉ PASA? 
> 
> ¡Qué pasa! **¡**QUÉ PASA!

### Old-style Figures `onum`
