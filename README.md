Currently supports:
- Basic Latin alphabets (A-Z, a-z)
- Diacritics latin alphabets (🇫🇷, 🇩🇪 and more!)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Basic punctuations and symbols
- and more (…?)

## Windows Compatibility

See [Issue here](https://github.com/karaipsum/Postulated-Proto-Alphabet/issues/1#issue-2312178558)

TL;DR: If you couldn't open or install the font, please use the files with a prefix of [W].

## Kerning Preview

![Kerning](preview/Kerning.svg)
> _One brings shadow, one brings light_
> 
> _Two-toned echoes tumbling through time…_
> 
> Excerpt from lyrics of [_Shadowbringers_](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/blog/002805.html)

Manually adjusted kerning pairs for improved readability. Toggle "Metrics" setting in your preferred design software to apply.

## Opentype Features Support (default off)

Below are currently supported Opentype features. They are based on my personal idea and interpretation, which I haven't noticed in official arkworks so far. They are **off** by default. You may turn it on for fun.

### Case-Sensitive Forms `case`
![case](preview/case.svg)
> ¿Qué pasa? **¿** QUÉ PASA? 
> 
> ¡Qué pasa! **¡** QUÉ PASA!
>
> Emet-Selch EMET **-** SELCH

When switching to all caps form, certain punctuation marks, currently `¿`, `¡` and `-` (hyphen), will switch to an alternate form. In this case, they will shift upwards to fit in the lines.

### Old-style Figures `onum`

![onum](preview/OSF.svg)
> $_**5,789,130,976**_

### Tabular Figures `tnum`
![tnum](preview/TF.svg)
> $_**5,789,130,976**_

### Stylistic Alternates `salt`
![salt](preview/salt.svg)
> « : * & »
